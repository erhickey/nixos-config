# NixOS Configuration Flake

This configuration allows the user to specify the host, operating system, and context.

The modules are not terribly modular or reusable, as I learn Nix/NixOS I will try to improve them.

This personal configuration works well for me. For others, hopefully it can at least serve as an example.
